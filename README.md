# CelesteRocketTurboMacro
A small turbo/macro for my Celeste While Always Dashing challenge run.

⚠️ **Warning before using: This program does not care about anything once it is running. If it is burried under other windows it may become difficult to close.**
**This is especially true for the enter key.**

Depending on input will mimick the keyboard and press one of the following keys repeatedly:
x: presses X key for standard dashing
s: presses s for crouch dashing
E: presses enter for pause buffering

Program rellies on the sleep function to advance time, so every millisecond the button alternates from being pushed and not being pushed.
